                    <h2>Ming Dynasty China</h2>
                    <p>

                    If you were able to be a traveler in time and go back to the 15th century, Ming China would be the place to start.
                    Ming China was heir to a long tradition of effective governance, sophisticated artistic achievements, and a highly productive economy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <img id="mingpic" src="assets/images/ming.png" alt="Ming" width="200px" height="200px">
                    The Ming (means “brilliant”) ruled from 1368-1644 and re-established the cycle of Chinese dynasties.
                    
                    They would be the dynasty in power when the Europeans arrived.
                    The early decades of the dynasty saw the effort to eliminate all traces of foreign (Mongol) rule, discouraging the use of Mongol names and dress, while promoting Confucian learning based the models of the Han, T’ang, and Song dynasties.
                    Culturally, the Ming looked to the past (pre-Mongol).
                    Politically, the Ming reestablished the civil service examination system that the Mongols had neglected and they created a highly centralized government based around the emperor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    A cadre of eunuchs personally loyal to the emperor had great authority, much to the chagrin of the official bureaucrats (as castrated men, there was no fear of them trying to seize power and trying to create a dynasty).
                    
                    The first Ming emperor (Hongwu) wanted to eliminate all governmental corruption (a major problem under the Mongols).
                    He tried to impress all officials with the honesty, loyalty, and discipline he expected from them through the practice of public beatings for those found guilty of corruption or incompetence.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    One student at the imperial academy dared to dispute the lessons of one of his teachers and was beheaded…his severed head was put on a pole and hung at the academy entrance.
                    There wasn’t a problem with order in the classroom after that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In 1402, a new emperor was crowned…Yongle (Yung la) =emperor of perpetual happiness.
                    He moved the capital of China from Nanjing to Beijing (1402)…an area to the north not far from the Great Wall which had been depopulated by the Mongols.

                    Emperor Yongle (r 1402-1422) sponsored an enormous Encyclopedia of some 4,000+ volumes.
                    With contributions from over 2,000 scholars, this work was to compile all previous writing on history, geography, ethics, government and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Yongle is also known for building the famous Forbidden City in Beijing.
                    Starting in 1406, Yongle had over 1,000,000 peasants conscripted to build what would become the largest palace complex in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Thousands of peasants were sent into the forests of southwestern China where they were to cut great timbers for construction.
                    These people were at the mercy of disease, starvation, and wild animals…it is believed over ½ of them died.
                    It would take four years to get these timbers from the forests to Beijing and when construction began in 1417, it would take 15 years to complete.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The Ming vigorously tried to repair the damage of the Mongol years by restoring millions of acres to cultivation; rebuilding canals, reservoirs, and irrigation works; and planting, according to some estimates, over a billion trees to reforest China.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As a result, the Chinese economy rebounded, both international and domestic trade flourished, and the population grew.
                    By virtually every account, Ming China was the best governed and most prosperous country in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    China also undertook the largest and most impressive maritime expeditions the world had ever seen.
                    Since the 11th century, Chinese sailors and traders had been a major presence in the South China Sea and in Southeast Asian port cities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <img id="zhengpic" src="assets/images/zheng.png" alt="Admiral Zheng" width="300px" height="400px">
                    An enormous fleet, commissioned by Emperor Yongle himself, was launched in 1405, followed over the next 28 years by six more such expeditions.
                    On board the more than 300 ships were nearly 30,000 sailors and soldiers, 180 physicians, hundreds of government officials, 5 astrologers, 7 high-ranking “grand eunuchs,” carpenters, tailors, accountants, merchants, translators, and cooks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Visiting many ports in Southeast Asia, Indonesia, India, Arabia, and East Africa, these fleets, captained by Admiral Zheng He (a Muslim eunuch from western China), sought to bring distant peoples and states into the Chinese tribute system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Dozens of local rulers accompanied the fleets back to China, where they presented the emperor with gifts (and tribute), performed the required rituals of submission (kowtow), and in return, received abundant gifts, titles, and trading opportunities.
                    Chinese officials were amused by some of the exotic products found abroad, especially ostriches, zebras, and giraffes brought back for the royal zoo.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Officially described as “bringing order to the world,” Zheng He’s expeditions sought to establish Chinese power and prestige in the Indian Ocean and to exert Chinese control over foreign trade in the region.

                    <h2>European Comparison</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                    At the other end of the Eurasian continent, similar processes of population recovery, political consolidation, cultural flowering, and overseas expansion were underway.
                    Western Europe, having escaped the Mongol onslaught but devastated by the plague, began to rebound during the second half of the 15th century.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Politically, Europe, like China continued its earlier patterns of state building.
                    In China, this meant a single, centralized government that encompassed almost the whole of its civilization.
                    In Europe, it was a fragmented system of separate, independent, and very competitive states.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Many of these states—Spain, Portugal, France, England, the city-states of Italy (Venice, Genoa, Milan, and Florence), various German principalities—learned to tax their citizens more efficiently, to create more efficient and centralized administrative structures, and to raise standing armies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    A small Russian state emerged, centered on the city of Moscow as Mongol rule faded away.
                    Much of Europe’s state building was based on the needs of war, a frequent occurrence in such a competitive and fragmented political environment.
                    Long term implications?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For example, England and France fought intermittently for more than a century in the Hundred Years’ War (1337-1453) over rival claims to territory in France.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Nothing remotely similar disturbed the internal life of Ming dynasty China.
                    A renewed cultural blossoming, the Renaissance, paralleled the revival of Confucianism in China.
                    In Europe, that blossoming celebrated and reclaimed a classical Greco/Roman tradition that had been kept alive in the Arab world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Beginning in the vibrant commercial cities of Italy between 1350-1500, the Renaissance reflected the belief of the wealthy/powerful elite that they were living in a new age, far removed from the confined religious world of feudal Europe.
                    The few educated citizens of these cities sought inspiration in the classical art/literature of ancient Greece/Rome—they were “returning to the sources” as they put it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The elite patronized great Renaissance artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael, whose paintings were far more naturalistic, particularly when portraying the human body, than those of their medieval counterparts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Even though religious themes remained prominent, Renaissance artists began to focus more on the secular, on contemporary figures or scenes from ancient mythology.
                    In the work of scholars, known as “humanists,” reflection on secular topics such as history, grammar, politics, poetry, rhetoric, and ethics was more important than religious topics.
                    Machiavelli’s (1469-1527) famous work The Prince, was a prescription for political success based on the way politics actually operated in a highly competitive Italy of rival city-states rather than on idealistic or religiously based principles.
                    Is it better to be loved or feared?
                    
                    Heavily influenced by classical models, Renaissance figures were more interested in capturing the unique qualities of particular individuals and in describing the world as it was than in portraying or exploring eternal religious truths.
                    In its focus on the affairs of this world, Renaissance culture reflected the urban bustle and commercial preoccupations of the Italian cities.

                    <h2>Ming vs. Europe</h2>
                    <p>
                    In China, by contrast, support for Zheng He’s voyages was very shallow in official circles, and when the emperor Yongle passed from the scene, those opposed to the voyages prevailed within the politics of the court.
                    Ming emperors after Yongle believed that China had been weakened by its contact with other people, so they were much more cautious in their trade with outsiders, and much more likely to believe that it was best for China to remold itself in the greatness of the past.
                    The Chinese were very much aware of their own antiquity, they believed strongly in the absolute superiority of their culture, and they felt with good reason that, should they need something from abroad, others would bring it to them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    China made the world’s most desirable products, especially after Ming craftsmen began creating distinctive and beautiful blue and white porcelain.
                    In 2007, this Ming jar sold for $3.9 million at auction.
                    The Ming understood that much of the empire’s wealth depended on trade, but its leaders (especially after Yongle) were always wary of outsiders, afraid to lose China again to rule by non-Chinese.
                    So they set out to rebuild the empire as independently as possible, repairing irrigation systems, factories, internal trade connections, and even the Great Wall.
                    Had Vasco da Gama encountered Zheng He’s massive fleet as his four small ships sailed into Asian waters in 1498, world history would likely be very different.
