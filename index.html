                    <h2>Ming Dynasty China</h2>
                    <p>

                    If you were able to be a traveler in time and go back to the 15th century, Ming China would be the place to start.
                    Ming China was heir to a long tradition of effective governance, sophisticated artistic achievements, and a highly productive economy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <img id="mingpic" src="assets/images/ming.png" alt="Ming" width="200px" height="200px">
                    The Ming (means “brilliant”) ruled from 1368-1644 and re-established the cycle of Chinese dynasties.
                    
                    They would be the dynasty in power when the Europeans arrived.
                    The early decades of the dynasty saw the effort to eliminate all traces of foreign (Mongol) rule, discouraging the use of Mongol names and dress, while promoting Confucian learning based the models of the Han, T’ang, and Song dynasties.
                    Culturally, the Ming looked to the past (pre-Mongol).
                    Politically, the Ming reestablished the civil service examination system that the Mongols had neglected and they created a highly centralized government based around the emperor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    A cadre of eunuchs personally loyal to the emperor had great authority, much to the chagrin of the official bureaucrats (as castrated men, there was no fear of them trying to seize power and trying to create a dynasty).
                    
                    The first Ming emperor (Hongwu) wanted to eliminate all governmental corruption (a major problem under the Mongols).
                    He tried to impress all officials with the honesty, loyalty, and discipline he expected from them through the practice of public beatings for those found guilty of corruption or incompetence.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    One student at the imperial academy dared to dispute the lessons of one of his teachers and was beheaded…his severed head was put on a pole and hung at the academy entrance.
                    There wasn’t a problem with order in the classroom after that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In 1402, a new emperor was crowned…Yongle (Yung la) =emperor of perpetual happiness.
                    He moved the capital of China from Nanjing to Beijing (1402)…an area to the north not far from the Great Wall which had been depopulated by the Mongols.

                    <img id="yonglepic" src="assets/images/yongle.png" alt="Emperor Yongle" width="300px" height="400px">
                    Emperor Yongle (r 1402-1422) sponsored an enormous Encyclopedia of some 4,000+ volumes.
                    With contributions from over 2,000 scholars, this work was to compile all previous writing on history, geography, ethics, government and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Yongle is also known for building the famous Forbidden City in Beijing.
                    Starting in 1406, Yongle had over 1,000,000 peasants conscripted to build what would become the largest palace complex in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Thousands of peasants were sent into the forests of southwestern China where they were to cut great timbers for construction.
                    These people were at the mercy of disease, starvation, and wild animals…it is believed over ½ of them died.
                    It would take four years to get these timbers from the forests to Beijing and when construction began in 1417, it would take 15 years to complete.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The Ming vigorously tried to repair the damage of the Mongol years by restoring millions of acres to cultivation; rebuilding canals, reservoirs, and irrigation works; and planting, according to some estimates, over a billion trees to reforest China.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As a result, the Chinese economy rebounded, both international and domestic trade flourished, and the population grew.
                    By virtually every account, Ming China was the best governed and most prosperous country in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    China also undertook the largest and most impressive maritime expeditions the world had ever seen.
                    Since the 11th century, Chinese sailors and traders had been a major presence in the South China Sea and in Southeast Asian port cities.
                    </p>

                    <img id="zhengpic" src="assets/images/zheng.png" alt="Admiral Zheng" width="300px" height="400px">
                    An enormous fleet, commissioned by Emperor Yongle himself, was launched in 1405, followed over the next 28 years by six more such expeditions.
                    On board the more than 300 ships were nearly 30,000 sailors and soldiers, 180 physicians, hundreds of government officials, 5 astrologers, 7 high-ranking “grand eunuchs,” carpenters, tailors, accountants, merchants, translators, and cooks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Visiting many ports in Southeast Asia, Indonesia, India, Arabia, and East Africa, these fleets, captained by Admiral Zheng He (a Muslim eunuch from western China), sought to bring distant peoples and states into the Chinese tribute system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Dozens of local rulers accompanied the fleets back to China, where they presented the emperor with gifts (and tribute), performed the required rituals of submission (kowtow), and in return, received abundant gifts, titles, and trading opportunities.
                    Chinese officials were amused by some of the exotic products found abroad, especially ostriches, zebras, and giraffes brought back for the royal zoo.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Officially described as “bringing order to the world,” Zheng He’s expeditions sought to establish Chinese power and prestige in the Indian Ocean and to exert Chinese control over foreign trade in the region.

                    <h2>European Comparison</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                    At the other end of the Eurasian continent, similar processes of population recovery, political consolidation, cultural flowering, and overseas expansion were underway.
                    Western Europe, having escaped the Mongol onslaught but devastated by the plague, began to rebound during the second half of the 15th century.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Politically, Europe, like China continued its earlier patterns of state building.
                    In China, this meant a single, centralized government that encompassed almost the whole of its civilization.
                    In Europe, it was a fragmented system of separate, independent, and very competitive states.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Many of these states—Spain, Portugal, France, England, the city-states of Italy (Venice, Genoa, Milan, and Florence), various German principalities—learned to tax their citizens more efficiently, to create more efficient and centralized administrative structures, and to raise standing armies.

                    <h2>Grading Policies:</h2>
                    <p>
                    Assignments will be posted on the course website. Deadlines are fixed; no extensions will be allowed.
                    </p>

                        <h3>Submit through Markus:</h3>
                        <p>
                        All deliverables must be submitted online through <a href="https://markus.cdf.toronto.edu/csc309-2016-05/">Markus</a>. All assignments are due 11:59pm on their due date. Submit early to avoid last minute submission-related problems, which will not excuse tardy submissions. Emailed submissions will not be accepted unless Markus is down.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Late coursework:</h3>
                        <p>
                        You can turn in your assignment up to 2 days late, but this will cost you 10% of the maximum grade for every day you are late (i.e., an assignment turned 2 days late can get a maximum of 12/15). No assignment will be accepted after the 2nd day; you will receive a grade of 0 for that assignment. If you are struggling with an assignment, talk to the instructor or the TAs for help well before the deadline.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Re-marking:</h3>
                        <p>
                        You have up to 5 days from the time the marked assignment is available for pick-up to ask the TA for a re-mark. No assignment will be re-marked after this period. If you are still dissatisfied after talking to the TA, then email the instructor to set an appointment.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Cheating/Plagiarism:</h3>
                        <p>
                        The policy of your faculty or school will be in effect. While you are encouraged to discuss the course content and assignments with your classmates, all work that you submit must be your own. When you submit an assignment with your name on it, you are certifying that you have done the work on that assignment yourself. Remember that the penalty for cheating is always worse than handing in the assignment late.
                        </p>

                    If you have a question, check the course <a href="http://piazza.com/utoronto.ca/summer2016/csc309/home/" title="Piazza">discussion forums</a> to see if it's already been asked and answered. If not, feel free to post your question&ndash;you will likely get a quicker response on the forums. If you think your question is not appropriate for the forums, feel free to email the instructor. If you do, make sure that you include "CSC309" in the subject line of your email. Otherwise it may get lost in the churn.

                        <h3>Self and peer assessments:</h3>
                        <p>
                        For assignments involving pairs or teams, each student must privately fill out and individually submit a self and peer assessment document through <a href="https://markus.cdf.toronto.edu/csc309-2016-05/">Markus</a>. A template can be found <a href="#selfpeer">below</a>.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Conflicts:</h3>
                        <p>
                        Students are encouraged to resolve conflicts on their own whenever possible. However, if you find yourself in a delicate situation and are unsure how to proceed, please contact myself or one of the TAs well ahead of assignment deadlines and we will help mediate.
